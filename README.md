# Image to Pencil Sketch App

This Jupyter Notebook application allows you to convert an input image to a pencil sketch using OpenCV and matplotlib libraries. The app reads an image file, displays the original image, converts it to a pencil sketch, and displays the sketch alongside the original image.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lohitkolluri/Image_to_Pencil_Sketch_App.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python matplotlib jupyter
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the "Image to Pencil Sketch App.ipynb" notebook in your browser.

5. Run the notebook cells one by one to see the output and generate the pencil sketch.

## Usage

1. Place your image file (in JPG format) in the same directory as the notebook file or in the "Examples" folder.

2. Open the "Image to Pencil Sketch App.ipynb" notebook.

3. Execute the notebook cells sequentially by clicking on each cell and pressing Shift+Enter or by using the Run button.

4. The notebook will display the original image using matplotlib within the notebook.

5. The notebook will convert the image to a pencil sketch and display the sketch using matplotlib.

6. The sketch image will be saved as "originalname_sketch.png" in the same directory.

7. The notebook will also display a side-by-side comparison of the original image and the sketch.

## Example

Here is an example of the original image and the resulting pencil sketch:

|              Original Image              |                 Pencil Sketch                  |
